# OVOS integration

Building a voice bot that answers a call, transcribes what the caller says with an
[OVOS](https://openvoiceos.org) STT/VAD pipeline, and replies with TTS.

## Install

```bash
pip install baresipy[ovos]
```

This pulls in `ovos-plugin-manager`, `phoonnx` (the default TTS engine), and
`ovos-simple-listener`. `baresipy` itself never requires these — plain `import baresipy` always
works — but `baresipy.ovos` and the default TTS lookup do.

You'll also need STT and VAD plugins, chosen for your use case. Examples:

```bash
pip install ovos-stt-plugin-fasterwhisper   # local Whisper-based STT
# or
pip install ovos-stt-plugin-server          # STT via a remote ovos-stt-server

pip install ovos-vad-plugin-silero          # or ovos-vad-plugin-webrtcvad
```

## Configuring plugins

Which STT/VAD/TTS engine actually runs is read from the standard OVOS config,
`~/.config/mycroft/mycroft.conf`, by the OVOS Plugin Manager factories
(`OVOSSTTFactory`, `OVOSVADFactory`) and by baresipy's own default TTS lookup
(`ovos_plugin_manager.tts.OVOSTTSFactory`). Example snippet:

```json
{
  "stt": {
    "module": "ovos-stt-plugin-fasterwhisper",
    "ovos-stt-plugin-fasterwhisper": {"model": "base"}
  },
  "listener": {
    "VAD": {"module": "ovos-vad-plugin-silero"}
  },
  "tts": {
    "module": "ovos-tts-plugin-phoonnx"
  }
}
```

Swap plugins by editing this file, not your bot's python code — the factories pick up whatever
is configured at runtime.

## `BareSIPMicrophone`

`baresipy.ovos.BareSIPMicrophone` (an OPM `Microphone` plugin) tails the audio a caller sent
during an active call and feeds it to any OVOS listener component. It requires the `BareSIP`
instance it wraps to have been constructed with `record_rx=True`, so baresip's `sndfile` module
is recording the rx leg to disk as the call happens:

```python
from baresipy import BareSIP
from baresipy.ovos import BareSIPMicrophone

sip = BareSIP(record_rx=True, headless=True)
mic = BareSIPMicrophone(sip=sip)
```

`mic.start()` blocks until `sip.call_established`, then opens a `WavTailReader` on the newest
rx recording. `mic.read_chunk()` reads and resamples audio to `sample_rate=16000` (default),
16-bit mono PCM — the format OVOS listener components expect — regardless of the call's actual
codec rate.

## Wiring `SimpleListener`

`ovos_simple_listener.SimpleListener` drives STT/VAD over a `Microphone` and calls back on
transcribed utterances:

```python
from ovos_plugin_manager.stt import OVOSSTTFactory
from ovos_plugin_manager.vad import OVOSVADFactory
from ovos_simple_listener import SimpleListener, ListenerCallbacks


class Callbacks(ListenerCallbacks):
    @classmethod
    def text_callback(cls, utterance, lang):
        print("caller said:", utterance)


listener = SimpleListener(
    mic=mic, wakeword=None,
    vad=OVOSVADFactory.create(),
    stt=OVOSSTTFactory.create(),
    callbacks=Callbacks(),
)
listener.start()
```

`wakeword=None` means the listener activates on VAD (voice activity) alone, with no wake-word
required — appropriate for a phone call, where the caller is always addressing the bot.

## End-to-end example

`examples/voice_bot.py` combines all of the above: a `BareSIP` subclass that accepts inbound
calls, starts a `SimpleListener` over a `BareSIPMicrophone` once the call is established, echoes
transcribed speech back via `speak()`, and stops the listener when the call ends. Run it with:

```bash
pip install baresipy[ovos] ovos-stt-plugin-server ovos-vad-plugin-webrtcvad
python examples/voice_bot.py
```

(edit the `gateway`/`user`/`pswd` placeholders at the top of the file first, or adapt it to
registrar-less mode per [docs/direct-calls.md](direct-calls.md)).

## TTS

`speak()`/`say()` need an OPM TTS instance. Pass one explicitly via `BareSIP(tts=...)`, or let
baresipy create the default lazily (`ovos-tts-plugin-phoonnx`, from the `phoonnx` package) the
first time `speak()`/`say()` is called without a `tts=` configured. Any object exposing
`get_tts(text, wav_file) -> (wav_file, phonemes)` works, so any OPM-compatible TTS plugin can be
swapped in.

## Latency and audio quality notes

SIP calls typically run at narrowband (8kHz, eg. G.711/PCMU) or wideband (16kHz+) sample rates
depending on the negotiated codec and peer; baresip's default config enables Opus (variable, up
to 48kHz) and G.711 (8kHz). `BareSIPMicrophone` always resamples to 16kHz mono via
`baresipy.audio.resample_pcm16` (pure stdlib, no `audioop`/numpy) before handing chunks to the
listener, since that's the rate most STT/VAD plugins expect — narrowband (8kHz) source audio is
upsampled and will not gain detail it never had, so STT accuracy on 8kHz legs is inherently lower
than on wideband calls. There is inherent latency in the pipeline: baresip must decode and write
each frame to the `sndfile` recording, `WavTailReader` polls for new bytes, and STT/VAD run on
buffered chunks rather than a true low-latency stream — expect turn-taking on the order of
seconds, not milliseconds, which is normal for this architecture.

[docs/http-gateway.md](http-gateway.md) exposes a `BareSIP` phone over HTTP/WebSocket instead of
embedding it directly in a python process — its `/ws/audio` route streams the same resampled
16kHz mono PCM audio `BareSIPMicrophone` reads internally, for consumers outside this process.
